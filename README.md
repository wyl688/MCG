Multi-level Contrastive Graph Learning for Academic Abnormality Prediction
The model code cites the literature when generating virtual nodes for the imbalance alleviation problem: 'GraphSMOTE: Imbalanced Node Classification on Graphs with Graph Neural Networks' https://github.com/ TianxiangZhao/GraphSmote.
The paper Multi-Scale Contrastive Siamese Networks for Self-Supervised Graph Representation Learning is cited in the context of multi-level contrastive learning for mitigating long-tailed distribution problems. https://github.com/ GRAND-Lab/MERIT

The model training requires the student's performance information and behavior association matrix as input.
